            <p> Graduation rates in New York City continue to improve, yet significant disparities persist across different neighborhoods. 
                This map highlights the lower graduation rates in School Districts 7, 8, and 12, which encompass the South Bronx, as well 
                as in School District 23 in Brooklyn, covering the Brownsville neighborhood. Students in lower-income areas are more likely 
                to drop out compared to those in wealthier neighborhoods. The challenges faced by students growing up in poverty include fewer 
                family members with high school diplomas, limited access to role models, and the pressure to work and contribute to household income at an early age.

               <p> These neighborhoods in New York City are predominantly made up of Black and Brown families, which has an impact on the graduation rates for Black and 
                Brown students. While poverty is linked to lower graduation rates, other factors also contribute to these disparities, including inadequate education 
                funding that fails to address the specific needs of racially marginalized communities.</p>
